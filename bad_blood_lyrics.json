{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Bad Blood par Taylor Swift\r\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\nNow we've got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve 'em\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\n\nDid you have to do this?\nI was thinking that you could be trusted\nDid you have to ruin what was shiny?\nNow it's all rusted\nDid you have to hit me where I'm weak?\nBaby, I couldn't breathe\nAnd rub it in so deep\n\nSalt in the wound like you're laughing right at me\n\nOh, it's so sad to\nThink about the good times\nYou and I\n\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\nNow we've got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve 'em\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\n\nDid you think we'd be fine?\nStill got scars on my back from your knives\n\nSo don't think it's in the past\nThese kinds of wounds, they last and they last\nNow, did you think it all through?\nAll these things will catch up to you\nAnd time can heal, but this won't\nSo if you're coming my way\nJust don't\n\nOh, it's so sad to\nThink about the good times\nYou and I\n\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\nNow we've got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve 'em\n\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\n\nBand-aids don't fix bullet holes\nYou say sorry just for show\nIf you live like that, you live with ghosts\nBand-aids don't fix bullet holes\nYou say sorry just for show\nIf you live like that, you live with ghosts\nIf you love like that, blood runs cold\n\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\nNow we've got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)\n\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\nNow we've got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve 'em\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"}
